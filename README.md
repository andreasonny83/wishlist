## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (at least version 6) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is optional but preferred over npm.

```sh
$ node --version
v10.11.0

$ npm --version
6.4.1

$ yarn --version
1.10.1
```
